# Clustering

This has not been tested and probably won't work...

To enable clustering set the following property:

    # turn clustering on:
    org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered=true
    
    # Must be unique for each node or AUTO to use autogenerated:
    org.quartz.scheduler.instanceId=AUTO
    # org.quartz.scheduler.instanceId=node1
    
    # The same cluster name on each node:
    org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName=clusterName
    
Each node in a cluster must have the same properties, except *instanceId*.
To setup other clusters use different collection prefix:

    org.quartz.scheduler.collectionPrefix=yourCluster

Different time settings for cluster operations:

    # Frequency (in milliseconds) at which this instance checks-in to cluster.
    # Affects the rate of detecting failed instances.
    # Defaults to 7500 ms.
    org.quartz.scheduler.clusterCheckinInterval=10000
    
    # Time in millis after which a trigger can be considered as expired.
    # Defaults to 10 minutes:
    org.quartz.scheduler.triggerTimeoutMillis=1200000
    
    # Time in millis after which a job can be considered as expired.
    # Defaults to 10 minutes:
    org.quartz.scheduler.jobTimeoutMillis=1200000
    
    # Time limit in millis after which a trigger should be treated as misfired.
    # Defaults to 5000 ms.
    org.quartz.scheduler.misfireThreshold=10000
    
    # WriteConcern timeout in millis when writing in Replica Set.
    # Defaults to 5000 ms.
    org.quartz.scheduler.mongoOptionWriteConcernTimeoutMillis=10000
